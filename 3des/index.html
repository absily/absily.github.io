                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><a href="https://www.absi.cc/2023/12/blog-post.html" class="text-warning text-primary" target="_blank">عربي</a><br>
<br><strong>On </strong>the third of December every year, the world celebrates the International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD). The aim of this day is to promote the rights and well-being of people with disabilities across social and developmental spheres and to raise awareness about their status in political, social, economic, and cultural aspects.
<br>
<br>I am from Libya, a country facing numerous challenges, including wars and economic crises. Consequently, people with disabilities in Libya encounter several difficulties, such as:
<br>
<br><strong>1. Lack of basic services: </strong>People with disabilities in Libya do not have equal access to fundamental services like education, healthcare, and employment compared to those without disabilities.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Discrimination:</strong> Individuals with disabilities in Libya face discrimination across various facets of life, including education, employment, and social integration.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Limited access:</strong> People with disabilities in Libya encounter barriers in accessing many public places and facilities, such as schools, hospitals, and public spaces.
<br>
<br>Despite these challenges, many individuals with disabilities in Libya are striving to achieve their goals. I am one of them, a Libyan with mobility impairment who couldn't complete education in schools due to their lack of accessibility, yet managed to receive education with the help of family at home.
<br>
<br>However, there's much more that needs to be done to improve the situation of people with disabilities in Libya. Reforms in government policies are necessary to ensure their rights and well-being. Additionally, raising awareness about disability issues within Libyan society is crucial.
<br>
<br>Outdated and inadequate laws: Laws governing the rights of people with disabilities in Libya, such as Law No. 5 of 1987 and the Basic Pensions Law of 1985, are outdated and do not meet the current needs of individuals with disabilities. They also do not align with international conventions ratified by Libya, such as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
<br>
<br>Here are some comparisons between Libya's policies towards people with disabilities and policies of other countries:
<br>
<br><strong>1. Comparison with developed countries: </strong>Developed nations have a better track record in disability rights. They have robust laws and policies protecting their rights and offer a wide array of services and programs, including education, healthcare, and employment.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Comparison with Arab countries: </strong>Policies towards people with disabilities vary among Arab countries. While some have strong laws protecting their rights, others suffer from deficiencies in services and programs.
<br>
<br>Despite the challenges, there is hope for a better future for people with disabilities in Libya. Many local and international organizations are working to promote their rights, and numerous individuals with disabilities are striving to achieve their goals.
<br>
<br><strong>On the third of December every year, we should remember that people with disabilities are fully-fledged members of society.</strong> It is incumbent upon us all to strive towards creating a more inclusive society for them.<br></p>
