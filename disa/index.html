<br>Persons with disabilities are an important group in society and deserve to live with dignity and independence, and to enjoy all the rights and obligations that other persons enjoy. However, persons with disabilities in Libya face many challenges that adversely affect their lives and their integration into society.
<br>Challenges Faced by Persons with Disabilities in Libya
<br>The most prominent challenges faced by persons with disabilities in Libya include the following:
<br>Outdated and inappropriate laws: The laws that regulate the rights of persons with disabilities in Libya are outdated, including Law No. 5 of 1987 and the Basic Pensions Law of 1985. These laws do not meet the current needs of persons with disabilities and do not comply with the international conventions to which Libya has acceded, such as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
<br>Inadequate infrastructure: The infrastructure in Libya, such as public buildings and streets, is not suitable for the needs of persons with disabilities. This makes it difficult for them to move around and access public places.
<br>Low pensions: The pensions received by persons with disabilities in Libya are very low and do not cover their basic needs.
<br>Weak services: The services provided by the state and civil society to persons with disabilities are weak and do not meet their diverse needs.
<br><strong>The Urgent Need to Amend the Laws
<br></strong>These challenges marginalize persons with disabilities and prevent their integration into society. Therefore, amending the laws for persons with disabilities in Libya is an urgent necessity, in order to guarantee the rights of this marginalized group and improve their lives.
<br>Points to Consider When Amending the Laws
<br><strong>When amending the laws for persons with disabilities in Libya, the following points should be considered:
<br></strong>Consistency with international conventions: The amended laws must be consistent with the international conventions to which Libya has acceded, such as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
<br>Meeting current needs: The amended laws must meet the current needs of persons with disabilities, including their needs in education, employment, and healthcare.
<br>Involving persons with disabilities: Persons with disabilities must be involved in the process of amending the laws, in order to ensure that the laws are appropriate for their needs and reality.
<br><strong>Conclusion
</strong><br>Amending the laws for persons with disabilities in Libya is an important step towards promoting the rights of this marginalized group and ensuring their effective participation in society. For this amendment to be successful, the points mentioned above must be considered, and persons with disabilities must actively participate in the amendment process.
<br><strong>Recommendations
<br></strong>Based on the foregoing, I recommend the following:
<br>The Libyan House of Representatives should take the initiative to amend the laws for persons with disabilities as soon as possible.
<br>The Libyan government should develop a comprehensive plan to amend these laws, in accordance with international conventions and to meet the current needs of persons with disabilities.
<br>The Libyan government should involve persons with disabilities in the process of amending the laws by forming a committee that includes representatives of this group.
